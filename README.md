# Hospital Management System (Vinmec)

A comprehensive healthcare management system built with modern web technologies, designed to streamline hospital operations including patient management, doctor scheduling, appointments, medical records, pharmacy, and payment processing.

## 🏥 Overview

This is a hospital management project developed by Group 1 for the ERP course. Although the system is still incomplete in some parts, it already includes the essential functions of a management system with full user roles. Due to the urgent two-week deadline, our goal was to complete a working version. After that, we plan to continuously improve and restructure the code.

This project is created for the community — a place where we contribute our humble knowledge, and above all, our dedication and passion.

Most importantly, we had the opportunity to work together — staying up late, discussing ideas, and coding side by side. As time passes and we each take different paths, we’ll always look back fondly on this beautiful period — when we had one another and shared the burning passion and aspirations of our youth.
